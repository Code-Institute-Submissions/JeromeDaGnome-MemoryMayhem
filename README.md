        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to play as a guest and get better at the game.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are white and black.  The buttons for the memory portion will be random colors every time.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Bebas Neue font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Bebas Neue is a clean font so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Memory Mayhem is all about the game.  The only imagery used would be the map of where the players that choose to include their countries show clusters.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily play the memory game and learn the controls.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable site. 
        2. There are no fancy graphics and the point of the site is plain.
        3. The user has two options, Play as a guest or play with a username, both of which will lead to the same place, to play Memory Mayhem.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to play as a guest and get better at the game.

        1. The Play as a guest option is the easiest and quickest way to get into the game.
        2. Memory Mayhem is always different every time so there is no pattern to memorize.
        3. The only way to improve at the game is to practice and improve your memory.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look at the map and see who else plays MemoryMayhem and where they are from.
        1. The map initially shows a very large top down view of the world showing clusters of users.
        2. The user can zoom in on specific spots on the map and see in more detail where users are playing from.
        3. The closer the user zooms into the map the more detailed the clusters will be showing specific countries instead of regions of users.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to play with a username and location.

        1. If a user picks the play with a username option they will be prompted to enter their own name and pick a country off of a list.
        2. Once they pick out their infomation the game will be playable.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to share the site with my friends.

        1. There will be a share link in the upper right corner of the screen.
        2. This will allow the user to share a link to MemoryMayhem to a friend via email, text or facebook message.
        
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to attempt to get on the top 10 leaderboard.
        1. Any user who submits their username and location will then be eligible to get on the leaderboard assuming they beat one of the top 10 scores on the list below the game field.
        2. The leaderboard saves the top ten scores of players who supply their name and location.
        3. When the user ends the game by getting a wrong answer but succeeds in surpassing one(or all) of the top ten users in the list their name and location will be inserted in the list in the appropriate spot.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to see what the top score is on the leaderboard.

        1. The user will have to scroll down to see the top score of the leaderboard.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to play frequently to get better at the game.

        1. Memory Mayhem is a quick and easy game to play to improve your memory.

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to attempt to get to the top of the leaderboard.
        1. The longer you play the better your memory will get.
        2. Better memory is a developable skill the more you use it the better it gets.
        3. Given enough time and luck you will be able to achieve greatness!
